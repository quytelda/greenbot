{"name":"Greenbot","tagline":"A modular Python based IRC bot that uses the Twisted framework.","body":"# Greenbot\r\nGreenbot's primary feature is it's ability to implement functionality via independant, easy to write modules. Modules are loaded at startup, and can be reloaded during runtime (dynamic module loading is a planned feature). A number of core modules are already present, including several useful logging modules. Modules can be added or removed by editing 'modules/init.py'.\r\n\r\nThe current stable version is v3.1 (https://github.com/quytelda/greenbot/tree/v3.1)\r\n\r\n## Getting Greenbot\r\n* Greenbot needs Python 2.7+ (it doesn't work with Python 3, currently)\r\n* Greenbot depends on the Twisted framework and pyOpenSSL.\r\n\r\nInstall dependancies using apt:\r\n\t\t`$ sudo apt-get install python-twisted pyOpenSSL`\r\n\r\n\r\n## Command-Line Options\r\ngreenbot can be launched with the following usage:\r\n```\r\nUsage: greenbot [options] [URL]\r\n--port     -p [port]\t\t  Port number to connect on (must be an integer)\r\n--ssl      -s \t\t\t\t  Connect using SSL\r\n--password -P [password]\t  Connect to the server with this password\r\n--config   -c [config]\t\t  Use a different configuration file at the given path.\r\n--username -u [username]\t  Connect with the given username\r\n--nickname -n [nickname]\t  Connect with the given nickname\r\n\r\n--foreground -f\t\t\t\t  Do not fork into the background\r\n--version    -v\t\t\t\t  Print version information\r\n--help\t\t -h\t\t\t\t  Print help information\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Configuration Options\r\ngreenbot's reads configuration files of traditional INI format, located by default in `./greenbot.conf`.\r\n\r\nConfiguration of the greenbot core is divided into two sections: `[server]` and `[bot]`.\r\n`[server]` contains configuration relevent to the IRC server (such as the address, port, and password), while `[bot]` contains configuration relative to the bot (such as nickname, username, and administrative password).  Here is an example base configuration file:\r\n```\r\n; server/connection details section\r\n[server]\r\naddress: irc.example.org\t\t; IRC server address\r\nport: 6667\t\t\t\t\t\t; IRC server port (defaults to 6667)\r\n\r\n; bot properties section\r\n[bot]\r\nnickname: greenbot\t\t; nickname to use when connecting\r\nusername: greenbot\t\t; username to use when connecting\r\npassword: password\t\t; password for authenticating to the bot (used by the `auth` module)\r\nautojoin: #tamalin\t\t; automatically join the given channels\r\n\t\t  \t\t; multiple channels should be comma separated\r\nadmin-channel: #greenbot  ; the bot's administrative channel (per the `channels` module)\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Adding Modules\r\nTo add a module to greenbot, put the .py file in the `modules` directory.  Then edit `modules/__init__.py` and add the new modules name to the `__all__` list.  Assuming everything works, the module will be loaded at start-time.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
